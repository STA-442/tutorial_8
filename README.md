# Tutorial

This week we look at building a multilevel model with more than one
nested group and then get a very basic introduction to using the
survival package in R to create basic survival objects and plot them.

This repository contains the following files

-   “more-than-2-levels.Rmd” - tutorial on adding more layers to a model
    -   “more-than-2-levels.html” - the knitted version
-   “basic-survival-analysis.Rmd” - Quick introduction to using the
    survival package
    -   “basic-survival-analysis.html” - the knitted version

Next week we will look at more complex modeling situations for survival
data.
